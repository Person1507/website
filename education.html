          <p>I attended Newtown High School in Newtown, CT from 2015 to 2019. I had a 3.9 GPA with High Honors every semester and earned the Rochester Institute of Technology Computing Medal. I also graduated at the top 5% of the class. I was very much involved in band in high school, participating in the Marching Band, Wind Ensemble, and Jazz Ensemble. High school is where my interest in computer science was ignited - I took AP Computer Science and loved it!</p>
