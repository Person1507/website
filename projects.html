            <h4>Integrated Customer System</h4>
            <p>This was a project from my Software Engineering course. It's a user interface for a system that keeps track of customer data for a dealership. It was implemented using the Java Swing GUI by me and another person. The project was meant to reinforce object-oriented programming and the software life-cycle.

            <p>This website was coded using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. Was developed through this <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website">Codecademy course</a>. The repository for this can be found <a href="https://github.com/Person1507/website">here</a>.</p>
            <h4>Electoral College Map</h4>
            <p>You know that electoral college map they have every presidential election? Since one of my interests is learning about politics/political science, I wanted to implement it! Yet, I am still working out which GUI I will use for it and the goals I have for it. Stay tuned!</p>
